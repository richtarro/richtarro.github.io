        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          The word "coffee" entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch
          koffie, borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish kahve, borrowed in turn from
          the Arabic قهوة qahwah.[10] The Arabic word qahwah was traditionally
          held to refer to a type of wine whose etymology is given by Arab
          lexicographers as deriving from the verb قَهِيَ qahiya, "to lack
          hunger", in reference to the drink's reputation as an appetite
          suppressant.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of the
          coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts
          of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen.[1] It was here in Arabia that coffee
          seeds were first roasted and brewed, in a similar way to how it is
          prepared now. Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay awake for their
          religious rituals.[14] Accounts differ on the origin of the coffee
          plant prior to its appearance in Yemen. From Ethiopia, coffee could
          have been introduced to Yemen via trade across the Red Sea.[15] One
          account credits Muhammad Ibn Sa'd for bringing the beverage to Aden
          from the African coast.[16] Other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of
          the Shadhili Sufi order was the first to introduce coffee to
          Arabia.[17] According to al Shardi, Ali ben Omar may have encountered
          coffee during his stay with the Adal king Sadadin's companions in
          1401. Famous 16th-century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami notes
          in his writings of a beverage called qahwa developed from a tree in
          the Zeila region.[14] Coffee was first exported out of Ethiopia to
          Yemen by Somali merchants from Berbera and Zeila, which was procured
          form Harar and the Abyssinian interior. According to Captain Haines,
          who was the colonial administrator of Aden (1839-1854), Mocha
          historically imported up to two-thirds of their coffee from
          Berbera-based merchants before the coffee trade of Mocha was captured
          by British-controlled Aden in the 19th century. Thereafter, much of
          the Ethiopian coffee was exported to Aden via Berbera.[18]

        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
          Several species of shrub of the genus Coffea produce the berries from
          which coffee is extracted. The two main species commercially
          cultivated are Coffea canephora (predominantly a form known as
          'robusta') and C. arabica.[41] C. arabica, the most highly regarded
          species, is native to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia and the
          Boma Plateau in southeastern Sudan and Mount Marsabit in northern
          Kenya.[42] C. canephora is native to western and central Subsaharan
          Africa, from Guinea to Uganda and southern Sudan.[43] Less popular
          species are C. liberica, C. stenophylla, C. mauritiana, and C.
          racemosa.
